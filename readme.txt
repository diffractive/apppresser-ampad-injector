## AppPresser HTML Inserter

This plugin lets you:

- insert arbitrary HTML in posts served in the AppPresser app.
- specify after which paragraph to insert the HTML content.

**Important notice:**

Note that script tags you insert in the HTML will most likely not get executed in the app. If you want to execute any client-side javascript code, follow the [official instructions](https://docs.apppresser.com/article/392-custom-javascript).
