## AppPresser Amp Ad Injector

This plugin injects google ad manager ads and lets you:

- choose the specific ad unit that will be used
- specify after which paragraph to insert the ad.

**Important notice:**

You will need to specify the data-slot of the ad block, so you will need to generate a tag in Google Ad Manager and from the generated tag copy the `data-slot` parameter.
The data-slot can be set on the Apppresser Amp Ad Injector under Settings on the sidebar of the admin panel.
